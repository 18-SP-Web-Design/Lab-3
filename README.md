# Web Page Design - Spring 2018

**Discussion:** In Chapter 3, you will have learned how to build web pages with
links, and embedded stylesheets. It's time to practice. Included are all the
files that you need. 

## Chapter 3 - Complete the tutorial as written in chapter 3 on pages 88-142

## Lab 3 - Links, Images, and Embedded Stylesheets

1. Complete the first two labs in the text on pages 147-150
1. Complete **Cases and Places** exercise 2 on page 152. If the writeup here
   seems confusing, all it is asking is that you create a web page with some text
   links and and then re-define their colors and styles, and then to think
   critically about why you might choose not to do this, and then discuss ways
   that you might use alternative link colors in ways that won't be confusing
   for your visitors. Add these comments to the bottom of the web page in a
   lt;p&gt; tag.

When you are finished, push the entire repository back to github.
